Last month the Microscope Meetup had <a
href="https://twitter.com/gontanon">Guillermo</a> and yours truly on a
for a <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/microscope-barcelona/events/235598538/">(Frugal)
Memory Management on the JVM</a> talk.

We presented some ways to understand an application's worload and detect
when it may be indulging too much on your memory.  Then discussed some
common practises to reduce footprint and, when these are not enough
other techniques to achieve zero-allocations on your fast path.

The recording is available at <a
href="https://youtu.be/DFub1L3gzGo">YouTube</a> and here are the <a
href="/assets/perf_analysis_jvm.20160527.pdf">slides in PDF</a> (the
video is immutable, but let me know any errors in the slides).
