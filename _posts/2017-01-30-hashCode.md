_In which scratching the surface of `hashCode()` leads to a speleology
trip through the JVM source reaching object layout, biased locking, and
surprising performance implications of relying on the default
`hashCode()`._

_Abundant thanks to [Gil Tene](https://twitter.com/giltene) and [Duarte
Nunes](https://twitter.com/duarte_nunes) reviewing drafts of this
article and their very valuable insights, suggestions and edits.  Any
remaining errors are my own._

A trivial mistery
-----------------

Last week at work I submitted a trivial change to a class, an
implementation of `toString()` so logs would be meaningful.  To my
surprise, the change caused a ~5% coverage drop in the class.  I knew
that all new code was covered by existing unit tests so, what could be
wrong?  Comparing coverage reports a sharper colleague noticed that the
implementation of `hashCode()` was covered before the change but not
after.  Of course, that made sense: the default `toString()` calls
`hashCode()`:

    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
    }

After overriding `toString()`, our custom `hashCode()` was no longer
being called.  We were missing a test.

Everyone knew the default `toString()` but..

What is the default implementation of `hashCode()`?
---------------------------------------------------

The value returned by the default implementation of `hashCode()` is
called **identity hash code** so I will use this term from now on to
distinguish it from the hash provided by overriden implementations of
`hashCode()`.  FYI: even if a class overrides `hashCode()`, you can
always get the identity hash code of an object `o` by calling
`System.identityHashCode(o)`.

Common wisdom is that the identity hash code uses the integer
representation of the memory address.  That's also what the [J2SE
JavaDocs for Object.hashCode()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode--)
imply:

    ... is typically implemented by converting the internal address of
    the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not
    required by the Javaâ„¢ programming language.

Still, this seems problematic as the method contract requires that:

    Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an
    execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently
    return the same integer.

Given that the JVM will relocate objects (e.g. during garbage collection
cycles due to promotion or compaction), after we calculate an object's
identity hash we must be able to retain it in a way that survives object
relocation.

A possibility could be to take the current memory position of the object
on the first call to `hashCode()`, and save it somewhere along with the
object, like the object's header.  That way, if the object is moved to a
different memory location, it would carry the original hash with it.  A
caveat of this method is that it won't prevent two objects from having
the same identity hash, but that's allowed by the
[spec](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode--).

The best confirmation would be to to look at the source.  Unfortunately,
the default `java.lang.Object::hashCode()` [is a native
function](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/a71d26266469/src/share/classes/java/lang/Object.java#l100):

    public native int hashCode();

Helmets on.

Will the real `hashCode()` please stand up
------------------------------------------

Note that the identity `hashCode()` implementation **is dependant on the
JVM**.  Since I will only look at OpenJDK sources, you should assume
this specific implementation whenever I talk about the JVM.  All links
refer to [changeset 5820:87ee5ee27509](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509)
of the [Hotspot tree](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot),
I assume that most of it will also be applicable to Oracle's JVM, but
things could (in fact, are) different in others (more about this later.)

OpenJDK defines entry points for `hashCode()` at
`src/share/vm/prims/jvm.h` and `src/share/vm/prims/jvm.cpp`.  The latter
has:

    508 JVM_ENTRY(jint, JVM_IHashCode(JNIEnv* env, jobject handle))
    509   JVMWrapper("JVM_IHashCode");
    510   // as implemented in the classic virtual machine; return 0 if object is NULL
    511   return handle == NULL ? 0 : ObjectSynchronizer::FastHashCode (THREAD, JNIHandles::resolve_non_null(handle)) ;
    512 JVM_END

[ObjectSynchronizer::FastHashCode()](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l601)
is also called from `identity_hash_value_for`, which is used from a few
other call sites (e.g.: `System.identityHashCode()`)

    708 intptr_t ObjectSynchronizer::identity_hash_value_for(Handle obj) {
    709   return FastHashCode (Thread::current(), obj()) ;
    710 }

One might naively expect
[ObjectSynchronizer::FastHashCode()](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l601)
to do something like:

    if (obj.hash() == 0) {
        obj.set_hash(generate_new_hash());
    }
    return obj.hash();

But it turns out to be a hundred line function that seems to be far more
complicated.  At least we can spot a couple of if-not-exists-generate
blocks like:

    685   mark = monitor->header();
    ...
    687   hash = mark->hash();
    688   if (hash == 0) {
    689     hash = get_next_hash(Self, obj);
    ...
    701   }
    ...
    703   return hash;

Which seems to confirm our hypothesis.  Let's ignore that `monitor` for
now, and be satisfied that it gives us the object header.  It is kept at
`mark`, a pointer to an instance of
[markOop](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/oops/markOop.hpp),
which represents the [mark
word](http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/HotSpotGlossary.html#markWord)
that belongs in the low bits of the object header.  So, tries to get a
hash inside the mark word.  If it's not there, it's generated using
`get_next_hash`, saved, and returned.

The actual identity hash generation
-----------------------------------

As we saw, this happens at
[get_next_hash](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l555).
This function offers six methods based on the value of some `hashCode`
variable.

    0. A randomly generated number.
    1. A function of memory address of the object.
    2. A hardcoded 1 (used for sensitivity testing.)
    3. A sequence.
    4. The memory address of the object, cast to int.
    5. Thread state combined with xorshift (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift)

So what's the default method?  OpenJDK 8 seems to default on
5 according to [globals.hpp](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/globals.hpp#l1127):

    1127   product(intx, hashCode, 5,                                                \
    1128           "(Unstable) select hashCode generation algorithm")                \

OpenJDK 9 [keeps the same
default](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/hotspot/file/fc7e94cb7485/src/share/vm/runtime/globals.hpp#l1198).  Looking at previous versions, both [OpenJDK 7](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/hotspot/file/5b9a416a5632/src/share/vm/runtime/globals.hpp#l1100) and [OpenJDK
6](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/hotspot/file/5cec449cc409/src/share/vm/runtime/globals.hpp#l1128)
use the first method, a [random number generator](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/os.cpp#l814).

So, unless I'm looking at the wrong place **the default hashCode
implementation in OpenJDK has nothing to do with the memory address**,
at least since version 6.

Object headers and synchronization
----------------------------------

Let's go back a couple of points that we left unexamined.  First,
[ObjectSynchronizer::FastHashCode()](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l601)
seems overly complex, needing over 100 lines to perform what we though
was a trivial get-or-generate operation.  Second, who is this `monitor`
and why does it have our object's header?

The structure of the mark word is a good place to start making progress.
In OpenJDK, it looks [like
this](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/oops/markOop.hpp#l37)

    30 // The markOop describes the header of an object.
    31 //
    32 // Note that the mark is not a real oop but just a word.
    33 // It is placed in the oop hierarchy for historical reasons.
    34 //
    35 // Bit-format of an object header (most significant first, big endian layout below):
    36 //
    37 //  32 bits:
    38 //  --------
    39 //             hash:25 ------------>| age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (normal object)
    40 //             JavaThread*:23 epoch:2 age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (biased object)
    41 //             size:32 ------------------------------------------>| (CMS free block)
    42 //             PromotedObject*:29 ---------->| promo_bits:3 ----->| (CMS promoted object)
    43 //
    44 //  64 bits:
    45 //  --------
    46 //  unused:25 hash:31 -->| unused:1   age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (normal object)
    47 //  JavaThread*:54 epoch:2 unused:1   age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (biased object)
    48 //  PromotedObject*:61 --------------------->| promo_bits:3 ----->| (CMS promoted object)
    49 //  size:64 ----------------------------------------------------->| (CMS free block)
    50 //
    51 //  unused:25 hash:31 -->| cms_free:1 age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (COOPs && normal object)
    52 //  JavaThread*:54 epoch:2 cms_free:1 age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (COOPs && biased object)
    53 //  narrowOop:32 unused:24 cms_free:1 unused:4 promo_bits:3 ----->| (COOPs && CMS promoted object)
    54 //  unused:21 size:35 -->| cms_free:1 unused:7 ------------------>| (COOPs && CMS free block)

The format is slightly different on 32 and 64 bits.  The latter has two
variants depending on whether [Compressed Object
Pointers](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/CompressedOops)
are enabled.  Both Oracle and OpenJDK 8 **do** by default.

Object headers may thus relate to a free block or an actual object, in
which case there are multiple possible states.  In the simplest,
("normal object") the identity hash is stored directly in the low
addresses of the header.

But in other states, we find a pointer to a `JavaThread` or a
`PromotedObject`.  The plot thickens:  if we put the identity hash in a
"normal object", will someone take it away?  Where?  If the object is
biased, where can we get/set the hash?  What is a biased object?

Let's try to answer those questions.

Biased locking
--------------

Biased objects appear as a result of [Biased
Locking](https://blogs.oracle.com/dave/entry/biased_locking_in_hotspot).
A ([patented](https://www.google.com/patents/US7814488)!) feature
enabled by default from HotSpot 6 that tries to alleviate the cost of
locking objects.  Such operations are expensive because their
implementation often relies on atomic CPU instructions
([CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap)) in order to
safely handle lock/unlock requests on the object from different threads.
It was observed that in most applications, the majority of objects are
only ever locked by one thread so paying the cost of the atomic
operation was often a waste.  To avoid it, JVMs with biased locking
allow threads to try and "bias" an object towards themselves.  While an
object is biased, the lucky thread can lock/unlock the object without
atomic instructions.  As long as there are no threads contending for the
same object, we'll gain performance.

The `biased_lock` bit in the header indicates whether an object is
biased by the thread pointed at by `JavaThread*`.  The `lock` bits
indicate whether the object is locked.

Precisely because OpenJDK's implementation of biased locking requires
writing a pointer in the mark word, it also needs to relocate the real
mark word (which contains the identity hash.)

This could explain the additional complexity in `FastHashCode`.  The
header not only holds the identity hash code, but also locking state
(like the pointer to the lock's owner thread).  So we need to consider
all cases and find where the identity hash resides.

Let's go read `FastHashCode`.  The first thing we find is:

    601 intptr_t ObjectSynchronizer::FastHashCode (Thread * Self, oop obj) {
    602   if (UseBiasedLocking) {
    610     if (obj->mark()->has_bias_pattern()) {
              ...
    617       BiasedLocking::revoke_and_rebias(hobj, false, JavaThread::current());
              ...
    619       assert(!obj->mark()->has_bias_pattern(), "biases should be revoked by now");
    620     }
    621   }

Wait.  It just **revoked existing biases, and disabled biased locking on
the object** (the `false` means "don't attempt rebias").  A few lines
down, this is indeed an invariant:

    637   // object should remain ineligible for biased locking
    638   assert (!mark->has_bias_pattern(), "invariant") ;

If I'm reading correctly, this means that **simply asking for the
identity hash code of an object will disable biased locking**, which in
turn forces any attempt to lock the object to use expensive atomic
instructions.  Even if there is only one thread.

Oh boy.

Why does keeping biased locking state conflict with keeping the identity hash code?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To answer this question we must understand which are the possible
locations of the mark word (that contains the identity hash) depending
on the lock state of the object.  The transitions are illustrated in
this diagram from the [HotSpot
Wiki](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/Synchronization):

<p align='center'><a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/Synchronization" alt="Hotspot lock state diagram"><img src="/assets/hotspot_object_states.gif" /></a></p>

My (fallible) reasoning is the following.

For the 4 states at the top of the diagram, the OpenJDK will be able to
use "thin" lock representations.  In the simplest case (no locks) this
means having the identity hash and other data directly in the object's
space for the mark word:

    46 //  unused:25 hash:31 -->| unused:1   age:4    biased_lock:1 lock:2 (normal object)

in more complex cases, it needs that space to keep a pointer to the
"lock record".  The mark word will thus be "displaced" and put somewhere
else.

While we have only one thread trying to lock the object, that pointer
will actually refer to a memory location in the thread's own stack.
Which is twice good: it's fast (no contention or coordination to access
that memory location), and it suffices for the thread to identify that
it owns the lock (because the memory location points to its own stack.)

But this won't work in all cases.  If we have contended objects (e.g.
objects used on synchronized statements that many threads traverse) we
will need a more complex structure that fits not only a copy of the
object's header (again, "displaced"), but also a [list of
waiters](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/objectMonitor.hpp#l126).
A similar need for a list of waiters appears if a thread executes
`object.wait()`.

This richer data structure is the
[ObjectMonitor](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/objectMonitor.hpp),
which is referred to as a the "heavyweight" monitor in the diagram.  The
value left in the object's header doesn't point to a "displaced mark
word" anymore, but to an actual object (the monitor).  Accessing the
identity hash code will now require "inflating the monitor": chasing a
pointer to an object and reading/mutating whichever field contains the
displaced mark word.  Which is more expensive and requires coordination.

`FastHashCode` does have work to do.

Lines [L640](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l640)
to [L680](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l680)
deal with finding the header and checking for a cached identity hash.  I
believe these are a fast path that probe for cases that don't need to
inflate the monitor.

From [L682](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp#l682)
it needs to bite the bullet:

    682   // Inflate the monitor to set hash code
    683   monitor = ObjectSynchronizer::inflate(Self, obj);

    684   // Load displaced header and check it has hash code
    685   mark = monitor->header();
    ...
    687   hash = mark->hash();

At this point, if the id. hash is there (`hash != 0`), the JVM can
return.  Otherwise we'll get one from `get_next_hash` and safely store
it in the displaced header kept by the `ObjectMonitor`.

This seems to offer a reasonable explanation to why calling `hashCode()`
on an object of a class that doesn't override the default implementation
makes the object ineligible for biased locking:

* In order to keep the identity hash of an object consistent after
  relocation we need to store the hash in the object's header.
* Threads asking for the identity hash may not even care about locking
  the object, but in practise they will be sharing data structures used
  by the locking mechanism.  This is a complex beast in itself that
  might be not only mutating, but also **moving** (displacing) the
  header contents.
* Biased locking helped perform lock/unlock operations without atomic
  operations, and this was effective as long as only one thread locked
  the object because we could keep the lock state in the mark word.  I'm
  not 100% sure here, but I understand that since other threads may ask
  for the identity hash, **even if there is a single thread interested in
  the lock**, the header word will be contended and require atomic
  operations to be handled correctly.  Which defeats the whole point of
  biased locking.

Recap
-----

* The default `hashCode()` implementation (identity hash code) **has
  nothing to do with the object's memory address**, at least in OpenJDK.
  In versions 6 and 7 it is a randomly generated number.  In 8 and, for
  now, 9, it is a number based on the thread state.
  [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1961146/memory-address-of-variables-in-java/20680667#20680667)
  is a test that yields the same conclusion.
  * Proving that "implementation-dependent" warns are not aesthetic:
    [Azul's Zing](https://www.azul.com/products/zing/virtual-machine/)
    **does** generate the identity hash from the object's memory
    address.
* In HotSpot, the result of the identity hash generation is generated
  once, and cached in the **mark word** of the object's header.
  * Zing uses a different solution to keep it consistent despite object
    relocations, in which they delay storing the id. hash until the
    object relocates.  At that point, it's stored in a "pre-header"
* In HotSpot, calling the default `hashCode()`, or
  `System.identityHashCode()` will make the object ineligible for biased
  locking.
  * This implies that **if you are synchronizing on objects that have no
    contention, you'd better override the default `hashCode()`
    implementation** or you'll miss out on JVM optimizations.
* [It is
  possible](https://blogs.oracle.com/dave/entry/biased_locking_in_hotspot)
  to disable biased locking in HotSpot, on a per-object basis.
  * This can be very useful.  I've seen applications very heavy on
    contended producer/consumer queues where biased locking was causing
    more trouble than benefit, so we disabled the feature completely.
    Turns out, we could've done this only on specific objects/classes
    simply by calling System.identityHashCode() on them.
* I have found no HotSpot flag that allows changing the default
  generator, so experimenting with other options might need to compile
  from source.

Benchmarks
----------

I wrote a simple [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
harness to verify those conclusions.

The benchmark ([source](https://gist.github.com/srvaroa/aa1f6c273ea6ae215bbf43e481f7689e))
does something equivalent to this:

    object.hashCode();
    while(true) {
        synchronized(object) {
            counter++;
        }
    }

One configuration (`withIdHash`) synchronizes on an object that uses the
identity hash, so we expect that biased locking will be disabled as soon
as `hashCode()` is invoked.  A second configuration (`withoutIdHash`)
implements a custom hash code so biased locking should not be disabled.
Each configuration is ran first with one thread, then with two threads
(these have the suffix "Contended".)

By the way, we must enable `-XX:BiasedLockingStartupDelay=0` as
otherwise the JVM will take 4s to trigger the optimisation distorting
the results.

The first execution:

    Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt       Score      Error   Units
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withIdHash              thrpt  100   35168,021 Â±  230,252  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withoutIdHash           thrpt  100  173742,468 Â± 4364,491  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withIdHashContended     thrpt  100   22478,109 Â± 1650,649  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withoutIdHashContended  thrpt  100   20061,973 Â±  786,021  ops/ms

We can see that the using a custom hash code makes the lock/unlock loop
work 4x faster than the one using the identity hash code (which disables
biased locking.)  When two threads contend for the lock, biased locking
is disabled anyway so there is no significative difference between both
hash methods.

A second run disables biased locking (`-XX:-UseBiasedLocking`) in all
configurations.

    Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt      Score      Error   Units
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withIdHash              thrpt  100  37374,774 Â±  204,795  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withoutIdHash           thrpt  100  36961,826 Â±  214,083  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withIdHashContended     thrpt  100  18349,906 Â± 1246,372  ops/ms
    BiasedLockingBenchmark.withoutIdHashContended  thrpt  100  18262,290 Â± 1371,588  ops/ms

The hash method no longer has any impact and `withoutIdHash` loses its
advantage.

(All benchmarks were ran on a 2,7 GHz Intel Core i5.)
