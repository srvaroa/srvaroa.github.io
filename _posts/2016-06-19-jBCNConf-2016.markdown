I hosted a workshop along with <a
href="https://twitter.com/gontanon">Guillermo</a> at the <a
href="http://www.jbcnconf.com/2016/">JBCNConf 2016</a>.  The materials
are online at <a href="https://github.com/srvaroa/jbcnconf"
alt="jbcnconf16: performance analysis and optimisation workshop
materials">GitHub</a> for your perusal.  The abstract contains info
about the contents and there are instructions in the repository.
Questions, comments and corrections are very welcome.

The workshop covered some concurrency examples from the (too) many other
topics discussed in the performance talk I gave a couple of weeks
earlier at the <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/BarcelonaJUG/events/230521537/">BCNJUG
Meetup</a>.  Feel free to check out the slides at <a

or just <a href="/assets/perf_analysis_jvm.20160527.pdf">download the
pdf</a>.
