The pipeline had degraded to the point of collapse. On the surface, the problem
was that it converged on a choke point that was easy to saturate and hard to
scale. But the real issue wasn’t having a bottleneck. It was pretending that
there wasn’t one, treating back-pressure signals as a nuisance, and letting an
AI-induced productivity anxiety run unchecked.

The system, let’s call it The Provisioner, takes a heap of hardware like GPU
servers and high bandwidth network fabric, and turns it into a virtualized
multi-tenant IaaS service. This is a wide scope. The system has many moving
parts that are diverse (from firmware to VM images through k3s clusters and
services deployed on it), individually complex, and interact through broad API
surfaces.

To verify the Provisioner properly, it must apply to real hardware and
construct a real environment where E2E tests can verify functional and non
functional requirements. But that verification process has limited throughput
by nature. It is inevitably time consuming (~2h for a full run) and depends on
exclusive access to expensive hardware that has multi-month procurement cycles
so scaling out more environment replicas is not an option.  

Poor throughput was problematic on its own, but it compounded with a surge in
the supply of changes, mostly related to engineers receiving an enterprise AI
license. Shoving more units of work into a system with slow service times is
quite a reliable way of building up even longer queues. But the real killer was
that AI also changed the psychology of the team, infecting them with a strain
of productivity anxiety. As the pipeline could not keep up with the rate of
changes, code-complete-but-waiting-for-verification work piled up in the queue.
Engineers couldn’t bear to sit on their hands. They picked up new tasks “to
make progress while the last change gets verified”, pushing even more changes
into the pipeline. Individually everyone felt more productive, but the delivery
system was slowly imploding.

To keep up with supply, delivery automation started batching changes in each
verification cycle. But batches had to get bigger and bigger, increasing the
frequency of failures and the complexity of troubleshooting. That forced the
team to stop the pipeline for hours sifting for bugs in a haystack of changes.
The idle pipeline brought even more anxiety. Wanting to get on with merging
changes, engineers tended to waive test failures as “flakes” or “perhaps not so
important right now”, sometimes rightfully so but others obscuring real issues.
Over time, this built a reserve of hidden bugs that made failures more frequent
and troubleshooting less reliable, reducing throughput even further.

The team was acting as if the verification stage wasn’t a bottleneck, but you
can’t get away with force-feeding a system with more work than it can absorb.
Eventually back-pressure appears. Here it did in the form of longer merge
queues and a chronically degraded pipeline.

The sensible response to back-pressure is to rate limit supply. We did it by
appointing a gatekeeper role in charge of regulating the flow of changes into
the verification queue, through intentional choices like bundling many small,
unrelated, low-risk changes, or by reserving a full cycle for a big, higher
risk feature. Some engineers argued that this wouldn’t fix anything, as it just
shifted work from one queue (“verification”) to another upstream
(“development”). But that was exactly the point. We had identified the
bottleneck, made back-pressure explicit, and let it propagate upstream.

When the amount of work stuck in development grew, we rate limited again by
limiting work in flight per engineer. Back-pressure kept propagating upstream.
Eventually, the spotlight landed on the real problem: poor planning.
Initiatives were being planned for execution only on the basis of business
priority and engineering capacity but failed to take into account that once
engineers got to work, different projects would easily hit the same surface of
the system, or compete for exclusive verification cycles. Those analysis gaps
remained latent until late in the development cycle, and surfaced as contention
disrupting the verification stage.

The Gatekeeper role was compensating for planning that should have been made
well before engineers started coding. We fixed this with an explicit analysis
of infrastructure dependencies during product and technical design. The
verification stage stayed slow, but reliable, so the team could squeeze its
capacity and release engineers from reactive firefighting. They spent more time
structuring execution work up front to minimize inter-dependencies with other
initiatives, which enabled parallel verification.

In a way, back-pressure is a negotiation between senders and receivers trying
to agree on a sustainable throughput. In healthy systems, receivers signal when
input pressure is excessive and senders back-off until the receiver becomes
comfortable. But agreement is not guaranteed. When receivers don’t emit
back-pressure signals, or when senders ignore them, the outcome is a
dysfunctional system that needs arbitration from the laws of physics. Which
tends to be unpleasant.
