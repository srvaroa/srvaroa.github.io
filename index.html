  <p>Hello.</p>
  <p>I'm a software engineer with a background in distributed systems,
  scalability and data plumbing.</p>
  <p>I work as a Principal Software Engineer at <a
     href="https://www.adevinta.com/">Adevinta</a>.  My team supports
   product engineering teams (~1500 people) accross the largest
   marketplaces in EU and LATAM.  Our mission is to remove the burden of
   operating infrastructure so they can focus on delivering more
   business value, faster.  We achieve that providing domain expertise
   and with IaaS / PaaS tooling, and quantifiable insights into cost,
   efficiency, and productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
     Prior to that I built distributed virtual networks at
     <a href="https://midokura.com">Midokura</a>,
     data infrastructure for telcos at <a href="http://zhilabs.com/">Zhilabs</a>,
     and backend systems for some high volume internet sites
     (<a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>,
     <a href="https://tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a>.)
     For more details check my
     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/galonavarro">LinkedIn profile</a>.
     I'm based in Barcelona.
