  <p>Hello.</p>
  <p>I'm a software engineer with a background in distributed systems,
  scalability and data plumbing.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a technical lead at <a
     href="https://www.adevinta.com/">Adevinta</a> for teams working on
   developer tools &amp; infrastructure. We support ~1500 product engineers
   across the largest marketplaces in EU and LATAM on their transition
   to cloud based infrastructures (mainly AWS, Kubernetes). We provide
   domain expertise and IaaS / PaaS tools to deal with the heavy lifting
   while they focus on delivering more business value, faster.
  </p>
  <p>
     Prior to that I built distributed virtual networks at
     <a href="https://midokura.com">Midokura</a>,
     data infrastructure for telcos at <a href="http://zhilabs.com/">Zhilabs</a>,
     and backend systems for some high volume internet sites
     (<a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>,
     <a href="https://tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a>.)
     For more details check my
     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/galonavarro">LinkedIn profile</a>.
     I'm based in Barcelona.

    I contribute to OSS occasionally, based on job needs and/or
    interest.  If you're curious, here are some PRs to
    <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Apr+author%3Asrvaroa+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aknative+">Knative</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/2303">Envoy</a>,

    <a href="https://github.com/tuenti/geoip/pull/1">Tuenti's fork of
      GeoIp</a>. At Midokura we made most of our development OSS, here
    is <a
       href="https://github.com/midonet/midonet/commits?author=srvaroa">the
       Midonet git log</a>.

  <p>Sometimes I write things:</p>

  <h1 class="page-heading">Content (<a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">RSS</a>)</h1>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
        <h2><a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
