<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am a software engineer with a background on distributed systems and data
plumbing. I'm more broadly interested how complex systems work. Right now I
work as Principal Engineer at Midokura building systems to manage fleets of
intelligent devices as part of Sony's Edge AI sensing platform, AITRIOS.
The <a href="/about">about section</a> contains more details about my professional work.  </p>

<p>
  My focus is mainly on building, but I believe that putting ideas into writing makes
  better thinking. Below you can find some of the content I've produced over time, 
  generally related to whatever is keeping me busy at the time. All opinions my own. 
  To keep up with updates you can use the
  <a href="{{ " /feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">RSS feed</a>, at least until I
  set up one of those email lists that cool kids have nowadays. I'm in
  <a href="https://twitter.com/srvaroa">Twitter</a> &
  <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@srvaroa">Mastodon</a>,
  and always happy to get an

<h2>Buiding a developer platform</h2>

<p>
During my tenure at Adevinta I led development of an internal
platform to support all the online marketplaces in the group
(including some of the biggest in Europe and South America). I
produced some content about strategic and technical challenges (yes,
before Platform Engineering became a short-lived hype :)
</p>

<ul class="post-list">
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/paas/infrastructure/platform/kubernetes/cloud/2020/01/02/talk-how-to-build-a-paas-for-1500-engineers.html">
    How to build a PaaS for 1500 engineers</a>. An overview of the strategic principles that we used to
    create Adevinta's internal platform. This was done before Platform Engineering became a thing, and
    remains relevant for any team working on technical infrastructure.
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/kubernetes/migration/latency/dns/java/aws/microservices/2019/10/22/kubernetes-added-a-0-to-my-latency.html">
    "Kubernetes made my latency 10x higher"</a>. This was the knee-jerk reaction of some product engineers when
    we ran into performance problems while migrating their services to Kubernetes. This post shows the
    actual cause was usually a result of blending complex systems together in ways we had not tried before.
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/kubernetes/eureka/paas/microservices/loadbalancing/2020/02/12/eureka-kubernetes.html">
    Migrating an Eureka-based microservice fleet to Kubernetes</a>. Technical deep-dive explaining
    how we achieved a smooth migration of the legacy service discovery and client-side load balancing to
    work with our new Kubernetes-based platform.  
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of my career I've worked with the JVM, sometimes I write
about things that catch my attention:</p>

<ul class="post-list">
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/jvm/java/openjdk/biased-locking/2017/01/30/hashCode.html">
    How does the default hashCode() work (and how it impacts biased locking)</a>. I was curious about
    how the default `hashCode()` was implemented in Java and ended up in a deep, although fascinating
    rabbit hole around the JVM's biased locking implementation.
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/jvm/kubernetes/memory/docker/oomkiller/2019/05/29/k8s-and-java.html">
    Sizing Kubernetes pods for JVM apps without fearing the JVM killer</a>. A common issue
    during the migration on JVM services to Kubernetes from the days at Adevinta.
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/gc/jvm/java/garbage-collection/latency/gc-pause/2018/04/28/gc-analysis-by-example.html">
    GC forensics by example: multi second pauses and allocation pressure</a>. A practical
    example of how to analyze a Hotspot GC log exhibiting large GC pauses.
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/jvm/java/garbage-collection/2016/07/25/jvm-tenuring-threshold.html">
    How does the JVM change tenuring thresholds, and when?</a>. Self explanatory, I guess?
  </li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/java/jvm/unsafe/2016/08/28/sun-misc-cleaner.html">
    Contention when releasing DirectByteBuffer</a>. I found a few threads of a dying application
    locked on `sun.misc.Cleaner`. I wanted to know why.
  </li>
</ul>
