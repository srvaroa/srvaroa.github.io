<p>
  I'm good at turning business problems into technical ones, and support
  engineering teams to solve them.
</p>

<h2>Work experience</h2>

<p>
  Most of my professional background has focused on distributed systems and
  continuous delivery, with over 10y in technical leadership roles and a 2y tour
  of duty as technical product manager. I operate best in hands-on roles inside
  engineering teams, but think at the strategic level in close collaboration
  with stakeholders across the business. 
</p>

<p>
  I currently work as Principal Engineer at <a
  href="https://www.midokura.com/">Midokura</a>. We build systems that manage
  fleets of devices capable of runnning applications based on AI models. These
  run as part of Sony's Edge AI sensing platform, <a
  href="https://www.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en">AITRIOS</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to that worked at <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, as
  a Principal Engineer for two teams that built systems to inspect real-time
  telemetry, infer what type of entity was reporting them so other teams could
  build New Relic's observability experience on top of them.
</p>

<p>
  At <a href="https://adevinta.com">Adevinta</a> I joined as a Staff engineer
  and later took a role as Technical Product Manager leading the development of an 
  internal platform that supported some of the biggest online marketplaces in
  Europe and South America to migrate to the cloud. You can find some

<p>
  Even earlier, I worked on distributed virtual networks, built data
  infrastructure for telcos, and some backend services for high volume sites
  like <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, <a href="https://tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a>.)
