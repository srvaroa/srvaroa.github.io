</p>

<p>
My background as a software engineer is focused distributed systems,
scalability and data plumbing, with extensive experience in
technical leadership roles and a 2y tour of duty as Product Manager.
</p>

<p>
I operate in hands-on roles inside engineering teams, but think at
the strategic level in close collaboration with stakeholders across
the business. My job is to ensure that engineering delivers
short/medium term company goals effectively, and is positioned well in
advance to anticipate the future needs of the business.

<h2>Work experience</h2>

<p>
  I currently work as Principal Engineer at <a href="https://www.midokura.com/">Midokura</a> building systems that manage
  fleets of devices which can running applications based on AI models. These run
  as part of Sony's Edge AI sensing platform, <a href="https://www.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en">AITRIOS</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to that worked at <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, as
  a Principal Engineer for two teams that built systems to inspect real-time
  telemetry, infer what type of entity was reporting them so other teams could
  build New Relic's observability experience on top of them.

<p>
  At <a href="https://adevinta.com">Adevinta</a> I joined as a Staff engineer
  and later took a role as Technical Product Manager leading the development of an 
  internal platform that supported some of the biggest online marketplaces in
  Europe and South America to migrate to the cloud. You can find some
