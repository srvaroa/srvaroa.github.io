<p>
  I am a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in <a
    href="https://staffeng.com/">Staff+</a> roles, specializing in
  distributed sytems, platform engineering, and continuous delivery,
  including a 2 year sting as Technical Product Manager. I excel on
  hands-on roles, combining technical execution with strategic thinking,
  and translating business and technical problems across large
  organizations.

<p>
  <em>(Since 2022)</em>:
  <strong>Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://midokura.com/">Midokura</a></strong>.
  We build systems to orchestrate, monitor and manage GPU servers and
  high-bandwidth network fabric for AI workloads, deployed in private
  datacenters. On an earlier project, I worked for ~3y on Sony's Edge AI
  sensing platform. We build systems to manage fleets of edge devices,
  deploy AI vision models, and stream real-time inferences to the cloud.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Re-architected core backend systems (MQTT, Kafka, JVM-based) for
      real-time inference streaming. Achieved 100x performance
      improvements, with lower resource footprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      Modernized release engineering and test strategy from fragile manual QA to
      automated delivery pipelines, reducing cycle time by 50%+ in
      complex embedded/cloud systems spanning distributed EU-JP teams
    </li>
  </ul>

  <em>(2020-2022)</em>:
  <strong>Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a></strong>.
  Embedded in internal platform teams managing entity inventory (hosts,
  containers, services, etc.), metadata and relationships. 
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintained critical infrastructure supporting most of New Relic's
      observability experience. Regularly in the critical path
      for ~50-75% of top-level company OKRs, and user-facing <a
        href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/service-level-availability-commitment/">99.8% SLAs</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Led design and implementation of high-throughput telemetry
      analysis system that processed millions of datapoints per second,
      inferring entity types and relationships from <a
      href="https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/">open, configurable
      rules</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Joined as lead in the Engineering Productivity team, and 
    later became Technical Product Manager of Adevinta's internal
    developer platform. Served 1500+ engineers across major online
    marketplaces in Europe and South America. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ideated, built and scaled developer tooling ahead of commercial
        alternatives (e.g. automated dependency propagation, developer
        metrics platform, etc.). Growing organically, from 0
        to hundreds of users with measurable productivity gains.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidated fragmented Infrastructure-as-a-Service projects
        (observability, kubernetes runtimes, etc.) into a cohesive PaaS
        that covered development, delivery and operations. (I published
        <a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/paas/infrastructure/platform/kubernetes/cloud/2020/01/02/talk-how-to-build-a-paas-for-1500-engineers.html">a piece about the platform</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Led platform migration of several marketplaces from on-premise
        infrastructure and EC2 to Kubernetes-based PaaS, reducing
        runtime and operational overhead and amplifying domain expertise
        from local teams to achieve impact across the wider organization. (I
        published some
