<h2>Work experience</h2>

<p>
  Most of my professional background is in distributed systems and
  continuous delivery, with the last 10 years in <a href="https://staffeng.com/">staff+</a> roles,
  including a 2-year tour of duty as a technical product manager.  I
  work best in hands-on roles within engineering teams, while thinking
  at a strategic level. I have extensive experience articulating
  business and technical concerns, and making them intelligible across
  large, complex organizations.

  <em>(Since 2022)</em>:
  <strong>Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://midokura.com/">Midokura</a></strong>.
  Contributing to Sony's Edge AI sensing platform. We build systems to
  manage fleets of edge devices, deploy AI vision models, and stream
  real-time inferences to the cloud. Some notable projects:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Re-architected core backend systems (based on MQTT, Kafka, and
      JVM) for real-time inference streaming. Achieved x100 performance
      improvements with lower footprint than the original systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Replaced fragile, manual QA and release processes with modern
      delivery pipelines. Over 50% reduction in process cycles by
      introducing test automation and infrastructure management in
      complex systems that integrate embedded and cloud software managed
      by distributed teams (EU-JP).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <em>(2020-2022)</em>:
  <strong>Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a></strong>.
  Embedded in internal platform teams managing entity inventory (hosts,
  containers, services, etc.), metadata and relationships. The platform
  is a foundation for most of New Relic's observability experience (we
  were regularly in the critical path for ~50-75% of top-level company
  OKRs.) Highlights:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Led the implementation of a high-throughput system that inspected
      every telemetry datapoint flowing through New Relic (millions/sec),
      inferring entity types and relationships from <a
      href="https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/">open, configurable
      rules</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <em>(2016-2020</em>):
  <strong>Staff/Principal engineer at <a href="https://adevinta.com">Adevinta</a></strong>.
    Joined as lead in the Engineering Productivity team, and 
    later became Technical Product Manager of Adevinta's internal
    developer platform. Served 1500+ engineers across major online
    marketplaces in Europe and South America. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        We created developer tooling before commercial
        equivalents appeared (e.g. automated dependency propagation, developer
        metrics platform, etc.). Generated traction organically, with
        measurable productivity gains.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidated Infrastructure-as-a-Service projects
        (observability, kubernetes runtimes, etc.) into a coherent PaaS
        that covered development, delivery and operations. (I published
        <a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/paas/infrastructure/platform/kubernetes/cloud/2020/01/02/talk-how-to-build-a-paas-for-1500-engineers.html">a piece about the platform</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Full migration of several marketplaces to the Kubernetes-based
        PaaS from on-premise infrastructure, and EC2 deployments. 
        We reduced runtime and operational overhead through via
        infrastructure, augmenting the impact of domain experts from
        local teams into the global platform team. (I published some
        <a href="{{ site.baseUrl }}/kubernetes/eureka/paas/microservices/loadbalancing/2020/02/12/eureka-kubernetes.html">technical</a>

    </ul>

<p>
  <em>(2013-2016)</em>:
  <strong>Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://midokura.com/">Midokura</a></strong>.
  Midokura built a distributed network virtualization system for
  OpenStack, where I took roles as core contributor and tech lead. Some
  notable projects:
  <ul>
    <li>Responsible for implementing distributed network protocols such as L2 gateways, VxLAN
    Gateways, NAT, Floating IP, Spanning Tree Protocol in the network
    agent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated our control plane to extend network state &amp;
      configuration to hardware switches (VTEP), transparently integrating
      physical and virtual networks (<a
        href="https://www.midokura.com/hardware-vtep/">feature
        docs</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <em>(Prior to 2013)</em>: I worked as a software engineer building
  infrastructure for telcos, and backend services for high volume sites.
  At <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, I managed the
  systems responsible to ingest and serve the world's largest music
  catalogue at the time. At <a href="https://tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a> I
  worked on backend systems behind groups, business and location sites.
